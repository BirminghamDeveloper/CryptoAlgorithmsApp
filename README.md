# CryptoAlgorithmsApp

CryptoAlgorithmsApp is an Android application built with Kotlin in Android Studio. This project demonstrates the implementation of various classical and modern cryptographic algorithms, providing an intuitive interface for users to encrypt text using different ciphers and hashing methods.

## Features

- **Shift Cipher**: A basic Caesar cipher that shifts letters by a fixed number of positions.
- **Monoalphabetic Cipher**: A substitution cipher with a randomly generated key for enhanced security.
- **Affine Cipher**: Combines multiplicative and additive ciphers to create more complex encryption.
- **Playfair Cipher**: Utilizes a 5x5 matrix of letters derived from a keyword to encrypt pairs of letters.
- **Vigenere Cipher**: Employs a keyword to shift letters by varying amounts, making frequency analysis more difficult.
- **Vernam Cipher**: Implements the one-time pad technique for theoretically unbreakable encryption.
- **SHA-1 Hashing**: Produces a unique hash value for given input, ensuring data integrity.
- **DES Encryption**: Uses the Data Encryption Standard algorithm for secure encryption.
